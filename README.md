This repository hosts my Computer Science BSc thesis, a program that solves the minesweeper game.

How can you start developing in this project:
1. clone the repository source code
2. download the dependencies from [here](https://github.com/ZsakaiBalint/MinesweeperSolver/releases/download/v1.0/dependencies.zip)
3. extract the zip file in your local repository's root and overrite the previous dependencies folder (you only have to do this once)
4. DONE, HAPPY CODING :)
